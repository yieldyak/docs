**Architecture**

Milk Vaults utilise the MIT License version of the [Boring Vault ](https://docs.veda.tech/architecture-overview/boringvault) smart contract architecture developed by Veda Labs.

Intelligent Vaults earn boosted yield.  Each vault has received an allocation of staked YAK tokens, which earns protocol revenue which is then compounded into the vault, boosting returns for all depositors. &#x20;
