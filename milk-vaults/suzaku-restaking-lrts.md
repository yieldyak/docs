# Suzaku Restaking (LRTs)

Yield Yak's Suzaku Restaking Vaults enables users to participate in Suzaku's decentralized marketplace for L1 economic security.

### rsAVAX, rstAVAX, and rBTC.b&#x20;

#### Deposit Token

* rsAVAX accepts sAVAX or native AVAX, rstAVAX accepts stAVAX , and rBTC.b accepts BTC.b.  In return users receive a restaked version (rsAVAX, rstAVAX, rBTC.b) at a 1:1 ratio

**Strategy**

* The vault functions as Suzaku's first 'Curator'
* Deploys deposits on Suzaku's marketplace to provide cryptoeconomic security to Avalanche L1s.
* Yield Yak strategists manage deployment decisions
* Auto-compounds rewards back into the vault

**Rewards**

* Base native yield (in case of rsAVAX and rstAVAX)
* Benqi Lending Yield (in case of rsAVAX exclusively)
* Suzaku Points
* Milk Points (see specific vault for multiplier)
* Future rewards from securing Avalanche L1s

**Milk Points**\
Milk Vault deposits earn Milk Points, our system for tracking contributions to the Milk ecosystem. Earn at minimum 3 Milk Points daily for every $1 of value deposited. Milk Points receive monthly YAK token distributions at the start of every month.&#x20;

#### Withdrawals

Users can request a withdrawal at any time and it will be automatically processed to their wallet within 30 mins.  5 minutes after withdrawal users can also manually complete the withdrawal from the UI should they wish to.&#x20;

**Risk Considerations**

* Smart contract risks (Yield Yak and Suzaku)
* Rewards (not deposits) can be lost if operators that Yield Yak delegate collateral to suffer from downtime.
