# rsAVAX - Suzaku Restaking

(COMING SOON!!!)

Yield Yak's Suzaku Restaking Vaults enables users to participate in Suzaku's decentralized marketplace for L1 economic security.

### rsAVAX&#x20;

#### Deposit Token

* Vault takes in sAVAX,  in return users receive rsAVAX (restaked sAVAX)
* rsAVAX is both a receipt token and a token which at some point may have further utility in DeFi.&#x20;

**Strategy**

* The vault functions as Suzaku's first 'Curator'
* Deploys sAVAX as collateral for L1 validation
* Yield Yak strategists manage deployment decisions
* Auto-compounds rewards back into the vault

**Current Rewards**

* Base sAVAX staking yield
* Enhanced Suzaku Points allocation
  * 5 Suzaku Points per day per $USD value (vs. 3 points directly on Suzaku)

In the future L1 Validation Rewards will also be earned.&#x20;
