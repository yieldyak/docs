# rsAVAX - Suzaku Restaking

(COMING SOON!!!)

Yield Yak's Suzaku Restaking Vaults enables users to participate in Suzaku's decentralized marketplace for L1 economic security.

### rsAVAX&#x20;

#### Deposit Token

* Vault takes in sAVAX,  in return users receive rsAVAX (restaked sAVAX)
* rsAVAX is both a receipt token and a token which at some point may have further utility in DeFi.&#x20;

**Strategy**

* The vault functions as Suzaku's first 'Curator'
* Deploys sAVAX as collateral for L1 validation
* Yield Yak strategists manage deployment decisions
* Auto-compounds rewards back into the vault

**Current Rewards**

* Base sAVAX staking yield
* Enhanced Suzaku Points allocation
  * 5 Suzaku Points per day per $USD value (vs. 3 points directly on Suzaku)

In the future L1 Validation Rewards will also be earned.&#x20;

**Fees**

There are currently no fees.  Yield Yak pays the costs for executing transactions on behalf of vault depositors.  However, once Yield Yak beings its role as Curator and is deploying capital to secure L1s, users should expect a fee to be added to the vault.  Advance notice will be given in this case.&#x20;

#### Withdrawals

Users can request a withdrawal at any time.  Withdrawals may take up to 5 hours to be fulfilled.  Once fulfil users will receive sAVAX directly into their wallet without need to claim.&#x20;

**Risk Considerations**

* Smart contract risks (Yield Yak and Suzaku)
* Market-dependent returns
