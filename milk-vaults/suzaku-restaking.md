# Suzaku Restaking

Yield Yak's Suzaku Restaking Vaults enables users to participate in Suzaku's decentralized marketplace for L1 economic security.

### rsAVAX rggAVAX rBTC.b&#x20;

#### Deposit Token

* Vault takes in sAVAX / ggAVAX /BTC.b and in return users receive a restaked version (rsAVAX, rggAVAX, rBTC.b) at a 1:1 ratio

**Strategy**

* The vault functions as Suzaku's first 'Curator'
* Deploys deposits on Suzaku's marketplace to provide cryptoeconomic security to Avalanche L1s.
* Yield Yak strategists manage deployment decisions
* Auto-compounds rewards back into the vault

**Rewards**

* Base native yield (in case of rsAVAX and rggAVAX)
* Suzaku Points at a 2.7x Multiplier
* Milk Points at 1x Multiplier
* Future rewards from securing Avalanche L1s

**Fees**

Suzaku Vaults launch with zero fees. A fee switch will only be triggered when Yield Yak can begin actively curating deposits in Suzaku's marketplace.

#### Withdrawals

Users can request a withdrawal at any time and it will be automatically processed to their wallet within 30 mins.  5 minutes after withdrawal users can also manually complete the withdrawal from the UI should they wish to.&#x20;

**Risk Considerations**

* Smart contract risks (Yield Yak and Suzaku)
* Rewards (not deposits) can be lost if operators that Yield Yak delegate collateral to suffer from downtime.
