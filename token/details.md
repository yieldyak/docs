# üêÉ Token Details

## YAK

YAK is the native token to Yield Yak. YAK is a fixed-supply token that can be staked to earn platform fees (currently 70% of all platform fees are distributed to YAK holders every 24 hours).&#x20;

* Only 10,000 YAK can ever exist. No additional YAK may be minted now or in the future
* Anyone can distribute platform revenue via [**Yak ARC**](https://yieldyak.com/arc)

## YAK Tokenomics

### Initial Circulating Supply

The vast majority of the YAK token supply entered circulation following the initial distribution. On the first day,

* Circulating: 7,350 YAK
* Non-circulating: 2,650 YAK
  * Team: 1,500 YAK
  * Ecosystem: 1,150 YAK

Tokens will move from non-circulating to circulating based on team tokens vesting and ecosystem tokens being used for community initiatives.

### Initial Distribution

Early users took considerable risk using a new platform. Their feedback influenced the product. Their deposits grew the platform. Therefore the initial distribution of YAK tokens is heavily weighted toward early users:

* 50% Depositors (airdrop)
* 15% Reinvest pushers (airdrop)
* 15% Team (vested)
* 15% Ecosystem
* 5% Community (airdrop)

### Airdrop Recipients

The full list of airdrop recipients is available [here](https://github.com/yieldyak/airdrop).

### Unclaimed Airdrop Tokens

Airdrop recipients were provided a 30-day window to claim tokens. Following the deadline, the remaining tokens were returned to the treasury.

## Mini Yak

Mini YAK (mYAK) is a wrapped version of YAK. Mini Yak introduces no changes to the YAK supply or tokenomics. Read more about Mini YAK:

### Conversion Rate

mYAK is pegged at a 1,000,000:1 ratio with YAK. The conversion rate is always available in a smart contract for both direction, although you may find better rates with [YY Swap](https://yieldyak.com/swap).

### Key Benefits

mYAK provides YAK with more liquidity while giving farmers an option to avoid impermanent loss associated with most LP staking options.

* mYAK/\* pairs increase YAK liquidity and reduce slippage using dex aggregators like [**YY Swap**](htps://yieldyak.com/swap)
* mYAK/YAK avoids impermanent loss for risk-adverse stakers
* mYAK gives users an option to avoid unit bias by having higher core amount of tokens in their wallet (100,000 mYAK = 0.1 YAK)

### Token Details
