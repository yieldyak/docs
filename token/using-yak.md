## YAK Farming

### Stacking Yield

Yield Yak has devised a novel way of stacking your yield. This allows you to auto-compound your YAK LP positions AND earn protocol revenue by staking YRT (auto-compounding asset).

You can earn stacked yield by staking an auto-compounding LP position. In this way, you earn yield on the underlying farm and again on YY Staking.

* Deposit assets into dexes -> Receive LP tokens
* Deposit LP tokens into [**YY Farms**](https://yieldyak.com/farms) -> Receive YRT (auto-compounding asset)
* Stake YRT tokens into [**YY Stake**](https://yieldyak.com/stake) -> Receive AVAX

## YAK as Collateral

YAK is accepted as collateral on [**Marginswap**](https://marginswap.exchange/margin-account) and [**Moremoney**](https://app.moremoney.finance).

* Deposit YAK in order to borrow other assets.
