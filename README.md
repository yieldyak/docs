# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Yield Yak

## What is Yield Yak?

### Auto-Compounder

Farms auto-compound your rewards automatically, saving you both time and gas-fees while you receive the benefits of compound interest.&#x20;

### DEX Aggregator

Yak Swap provides one-click trade execution with multi-step routes and low slippage.&#x20;

### Yield Booster

Benefit from Yield Yak strategies to earn higher yields using Yield Yak than you can on your own.&#x20;

### Avalanche Liquid Staking Provider

yyAVAX lets you earn native yield for securing the Avalanche Network without sacrificing DeFi utility.&#x20;

### Community Driven

Yield Yak is a community-focused project. The Yield Yak community have built and maintained the best and most diverse yield optimiser on the market.

### Self-Sustaining

Yield Yak is largely self-sustaining. Our community compounds rewards, suggests new strategies, proposes key configuration updates and contributes to development. Yield Yak Farms can run forever, without the team's involvement.

## How does Yield Yak work?

Yield Yak auto-compounds yield farm rewards.

* Each farm is a pool of deposits from Yield Yak users
* Farms earn reward tokens
* Farms reinvest all rewards, compounding everyone's deposits

All depositors benefit from the high frequency of Yield Yak compounding. Learn more:

## How do I get started?

Before you start using Yield Yak, you will need:

1. A Web3 Wallet such as[ Rabby](https://rabby.io/).&#x20;
2. &#x20;ETH on Arbitrum or AVAX on the Avalanche C-Chain in your wallet&#x20;

## Can I lose money?

Yes. Use Yield Yak at your own risk with money you can afford to lose. Do your own research. Yield Yak works with auditors [CoinFabrik](https://coinfabrik.com) to periodically audit high-TVL strategies, however not all farms are audited, which is especially true for new ones. &#x20;

Additionally, Yield Yak relies on smart contracts from other platforms which may be unaudited. Any funds lost by other platforms will affect Yield Yak users.
