# 👉 Why use YY Swap?

## Best Price Search

Even for the same pair of token swap, say buying $YAK using $AVAX, there are many Dex’s on Avalanche to choose. Although the existence of the arbitrage may help converge the price ratio on different Dex’s, there may still be a difference. Yield Yak Swap compares the prices available on most Dex’s and finds out the best one for you.

## Price Slippage

Price slippage could be viewed as a punishment of reducing the liquidity of to-token in a swap. Usually, a big amount swap in a Dex with low liquidity of the to-token would result in high price slippage and therefore significantly reduce the amount of received token. YY Swap takes price slippage into account and offers you the best execution route.

## One-Click Execution

Sometimes, you may be exchanging two tokens that do not have liquidity on the same Dex simultaneously. For example, you want to trade from $YAK to $ELK. Liquidity pairs involving $YAK are on Pangolin, Trader Joe, Lydia, etc. However, these Dex’s have minimal $ELK liquidity. A direct swap from YAK to $ELK on these platforms would result in a huge loss. Most liquidity of $ELK are on ELK. A two-path swap from $YAK to $AVAX on Pangolin first and then from $AVAX to $ELK on ELK could avoid the huge loss.

YY Swap detects all these possible multi-step execution routes for comparison. We offer you the best price available and you can execute it just by one click on YY Swap. The transaction would pass through the required smart contracts and finish the swap.
